Assessment Duration: 3 hours (9:00 AM- 12:00 PM)   
Foreword   
Dear Participants,   
Welcome to your technical examination! This exam is designed to assess your problem-solving skills, 
logical thinking, and ability to apply JavaScript (preferred) or Java concepts in real-world scenarios.  
Throughout this test, you will work with core programming principles such as functions, loops, 
conditionals, recursion, and advanced array operations.   
Each question presents a practical scenario where your task is to analyze, implement, and optimize 
solutions. Pay close attention to how you structure your code, ensuring efficiency, readability, and 
correctness. The exam will also challenge you to compare different approaches, highlighting tradeoffs 
in performance and best practices.   
Remember:   
Write clean and well-structured code. Follow good programming practices, including proper 
variable naming and indentation.   
Explain your reasoning. Some questions require a discussion—use clear and concise 
explanations.   
Think critically. There may be multiple solutions; choose the most optimal one.   
Manage your time wisely. Read each question carefully before coding.   
This is not just a test of knowledge but a chance to demonstrate your problem-solving skills and logical 
thinking. Take your time, stay focused, and enjoy the challenge.   
We believe in your abilities—now go ahead and code with confidence!

Subject: Backend technical assessment submission - March 7th, 2025 
Please ensure your code is fully tested and runs correctly locally before 
submission.   
Note: All questions are compulsory.   
Best of luck!   
  
Question 1: Functions, Loops, and Conditionals   
Scenario: You are building a simple access control system for a bootcamp. Each user has a name 
(string) and a role (either "admin", "instructor", or "student").   
Sub-questions:   
a. Write a function countRoles(users) that takes an array of user objects and returns an object 
showing the count of each role.   
b. Example output: { admin: 2, instructor: 1, student: 5 }. (Use loops and conditional statements.)   
c. Write a function findAdmins(users) that returns an array of names of all users with the role 
"admin". (Use the filter method.)   
d. Modify the findAdmins function to return "No admins found" if there are no admins.   
e. Write a function generateWelcomeMessages(users) that returns an array of messages like   
"Welcome, [name]! You are an [role]."   
f. 
(Use map.)   
g. Discuss the advantages of using array methods (map, filter) over traditional loops in this 
scenario.   
QUESTION 2: Recursion and Algorithmic Thinking   
Scenario: You are working on an encryption system for a messaging app. You need to perform 
some recursive operations on strings and numbers.   
Sub-questions: a. Write a recursive function sumDigits(n) that takes a number and 
returns the sum of its digits. Example: sumDigits(123) → 6.   
a. Write a recursive function power(base, exponent) that calculates base^exponent. 
Example: power(2, 3) → 8.   
b. Write a recursive function reverseWords(sentence) that reverses the order of words in a 
string. Example: "Hello world" → "world Hello".   
c. Explain: When is recursion less efficient than iteration? Provide an example where 
iteration would be a better choice (such as in cases with large datasets or deep 
recursion).   
d. Convert the sumDigits(n) function to an iterative version. Compare the performance of 
both the recursive and iterative approaches when handling large numbers.   
Question 3: Advanced Array Operations and Performance Considerations   
Scenario: You are optimizing a bootcamp platform’s leaderboard system. You have an array of student 
scores and need to manipulate and analyze the data efficiently.   
Sub-questions:   
a Write a function findTopScorers(students, threshold) that returns an array of names of students who 
scored above the given threshold. (Use filter.)   
b Write a function sortStudentsByScore(students) that returns a new array of students sorted in 
descending order based on their scores. (Use sort.)   
c Write a function removeDuplicates(arr) that removes duplicate numbers from an array without using 
the Set object.   
d Write a function getMedianScore(scores) that calculates the median score of an array of numbers.  
e Discuss how sorting affects performance and the time complexity of different sorting algorithms.   
Question 4: Library Management System   
You are developing a system for managing books in a library. Each book has a title (string), 
author (string), and publication year (number).   
a. Write a function groupBooksByAuthor(books) that takes an array of book objects and 
returns an object where keys are authors and values are arrays of books by that author. 
b. Write a function findBooksPublishedAfter(books, year) that returns an array of book 
titles published after the given year. (Use filter.)   
c. Write a function generateBookSummaries(books) that returns an array of strings, where 
each string is a summary of a book in the format: "[Title] by [Author] ([Publication   
Year])". (Use map.)   
d. Write a function sortByPublicationYear(books) that sorts the books by publication year, 
oldest to newest. (Use sort.)
